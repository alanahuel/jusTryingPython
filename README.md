## About

justTryingPython is a personal learning project, initiated out of my keen interest in the Python programming language. Python, with its simplicity and extensive libraries, is often the language of choice for beginners as well as professionals in the field of cybersecurity, which is my area of focus.

This project's aim is to gradually increase in complexity, thus providing me with an immersive, hands-on learning experience that will sharpen my programming skills. Python, owing to its versatility, enables me to experiment with a wide array of concepts and approaches.

## Intent and Scope

The main intent behind justTryingPython is to create an assortment of projects, each designed to be more complex than the last. By undertaking such a progressive approach, I hope to further my understanding of Python and its applications in a more structured and holistic manner.

Pentesting, or penetration testing, is a core focus of these projects. Through this, I aim to learn the ways Python can be leveraged for ethical hacking, exploiting vulnerabilities, network security, and much more. Each project will involve aspects of pentesting, either directly or indirectly, offering a practical learning experience in this particular domain.

## What to Expect

As the justTryingPython project unfolds, expect a variety of scripts, applications, and tools designed for or around pentesting. These will cover a broad range of subjects, from automation and data analysis to network interactions and security assessments.

These resources are primarily meant for my learning. However, they are open-source and available for anyone interested in Python or cybersecurity. Feedback, suggestions, or contributions are most welcome, as they will not only aid in my learning journey but also improve the overall quality and utility of the project.

## Contribution

While justTryingPython is primarily a personal learning endeavor, input and contributions from others are greatly appreciated. If you have any suggestions, comments, or corrections, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Remember, the aim here is to learn and grow together.
